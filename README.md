# CyberSentinel
CyberSentinel-Intelligence is an autonomous, self-learning Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) designed to secure modern digital infrastructures against evolving cyber threats. Unlike traditional security systems that rely on static, signature-based rules, this project implements a "Zero-Touch" security framework.
